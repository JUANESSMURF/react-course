# Proyect E-COMMERCE-WEBSITE with React and Vite

***
A little about the process of making this proyect
***

## ROUTING

1. Routing is one of the first things i did to make the website with React Router DOM. In / Pages/App/index.jsx thats the main file of our app I had to import *import { useRoutes, BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';* 1rst Line of code.

2.I create a function arrow *AppRoutes* with the paths of every page that we will create on this proyect.

3. On the main function arrow call *App* we had to return this element called *<BrowserRouter>* and inside the main function declarate the *AppRoutes* that conect the pages that we want to create and the paths.
